It was on <strong>Volley</strong> which is a new framework announced at this years I/O and it provides simpler and faster data transfers. When Volley was announced at I/O I instantly wanted to use it in the app I was working on but it had little to no documentation. I was hoping this might have changed 7 months later but to my dismay, on the powerpoint slide listing the downsides to Volley, the only item was “No documentation”. </p>\n<p>The rest of the talks were pretty dissapointing, mostly companies pushing their products rather than inspiring us or providing us with new ideas. </p>\n<p>Another cool moment was that for some reason there was an <strong>Oculus Rift</strong> set up with a full cockpit and iRacing. The Oculus definitely does a great job at providing an immersive experience but I found the resolution incredibly low and made it quite hard to use.</p>\n<p>To end with, it was interesting to see that even in <strong>Spain</strong>, the majority of the developers present were coding on a Macbook, taking photos with their iPad and messaging on their iPhone. There was also a small group of diehard Blackberry users doing their best to convince the Android users to make the switch while still being able to develop for Android.</p>',frontmatter:{date:"December 10, 2013",path:"/droicon-mad.html",tags:["tag"],title:"Droidcon",image:{childImageSharp:{resize:{src:"/static/balloons-4e9a95cf7025f7dc1da351e45e9f97b3-57c0c.jpg"}}}}}},pathContext:{prev:{excerpt:"Best Movies: 2013  was a tricky year for movies, I was starting to wonder if I could even make up a list as I couldn’t think of any blockbusters I’d want to watch again(Apart from White House Down but I’d lose all credibility if I put that on a “Best…",html:'<h3 id="best-movies"><a href="#best-movies" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a><strong>Best Movies:</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>2013</strong> was a tricky year for movies, I was starting to wonder if I could even make up a list as I couldn’t think of any blockbusters I’d want to watch again(Apart from White House Down but I’d lose all credibility if I put that on a “Best of” list), thankfully good old <strong>indies</strong> came to the rescue.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Place Beyond The Pines</strong> </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Way Way Back</strong> </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Kings of Summer</strong> </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sound City</strong> </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>  <strong>Footnote:</strong><br>\nI feel like this list could easily change over the next couple of months as there are a lot of movies I’ve yet to see from 2013 such as “Dallas Buyers Club”, “The Counselor” and “The Wolf of Wall Street” all of which could easily end up topping my list.
