I don’t blame them, if a company thinks buying another company is worth x money then they expect to make a lot more than x money from owning it.</p>\n<p>But when people blindly make the switch they might easily be moving to a service with the same intentions or worse than what <strong>Facebook</strong> could turn <strong>Whatsapp</strong> into.</p>\n<p>One of these alternative chat services is <strong>Telegram</strong> that quite surprisingly was already making some impressive traction months before the <strong>Whatsapp</strong> acquisition came about.</p>\n<p>They follow a similar plan as <strong>Whatsapp</strong>, make a great experience and worry about making money once you have an impressive userbase. The difference with <strong>Telegram</strong> is that they are selling themselves as the <strong>“secure”</strong> alternative and because of this claim I’m here today.</p>\n<p>Obviously, why wouldn’t they sell themselves as the secure alternative, it makes great sense with all the <strong>NSA</strong>, <strong>GCHQ</strong> spying being a hot topic these days. Then they throw in that they are open source by making their <a href="%22https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram%22">clients</a> available on github and detailing their <a href="%22https://core.telegram.org/mtproto%22">crypto technique</a>.</p>\n<p>All is well and good making your clients open source and I applaud any company that does but particularly when we’re talking about a chat service whose selling point is security, what use is open source clients when the server remains proprietary. All we can be sure of is that our messages are secure when they’re on the client, as soon as they’re sent to a black box server we have no certainty of what next happens to our messages. More worrying is that <a href="%22http://community.kde.org/GSoC/2014/Ideas#Project:_Telegram_Network_Support%22">multiple</a> <a href="%22http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Ideas_for_Google_Summer_of_Code%22">organizations</a> that have been accepted into this years Google Summer of Code have ideas on their project page to incorporate telegram into their project, this seems crazy to me and incredibly shortsighted.</p>\n<p>Next, detailing your crypto that super Ph.Ds in Maths created is all well and good until people start debunking its security within <a href="%22http://unhandledexpression.com/2013/12/17/telegram-stand-back-we-know-maths/%22">days</a>. Also, making a <a href="%22http://thoughtcrime.org/blog/telegram-crypto-challenge/%22">competition with flawed rules</a>  is a surefire way to turn the community against you even more.</p>\n<p>But let’s step back for a second and imagine that <strong>Telegram</strong> was identical to <strong>Whatsapp</strong>, no claims of security and people use it fully understanding that they have no control over anything once it has been sent, who exactly is <strong>Telegram</strong>? A small startup out to disrupt? Nop, not even close, <strong>Telegram</strong> was founded by the same cofounders of <strong><a href="%22http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VK_(social_network)%22">VK</a></strong>, the second largest social network in Europe. That fact alone should keep people far away from <strong>Telegram</strong>, you don’t trust <strong>Facebook</strong>? A site you use everyday? But you do trust someone in the exact same business of profiting from it’s users information that you don’t even use?</p>\n<p>So what chat service should you use if you want everything to be secure? Well, there probably isn’t and there never will be. There are options like <a href="%22https://crypto.cat%22">Cryptocat</a> but how sure can you really be?</p>\n<p>And this is where I’ve ended up, it all comes down to how much you <strong>Trust</strong> the companies whose products you use, my messenger of choice is currently <strong>Google Hangouts</strong>, it’s probably not secure, <strong>Google</strong> can read everything, the clients suck, but I’ve been using <strong>Google</strong> services for a long time and until now nothing bad has happened so a level of trust has been built up. And that’s it, it’s as safe to use as my trust in the company.</p>\n<p>Nothing more.</p>',id:"/home/circleci/repo/posts/2014-03-09-Telegram/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:3,frontmatter:{date:"2014-03-09T12:00:00+00:00",path:"/telegram.html",tags:["tag"],title:"FOSS isn't enough STOP Trust is everything STOP"}},next:{excerpt:"Today I attended a series of talks related to Android at the  Madrid  edition of DroidCon 2013.

It was on <strong>Volley</strong> which is a new framework announced at this years I/O and it provides simpler and faster data transfers. When Volley was announced at I/O I instantly wanted to use it in the app I was working on but it had little to no documentation. I was hoping this might have changed 7 months later but to my dismay, on the powerpoint slide listing the downsides to Volley, the only item was “No documentation”. </p>\n<p>The rest of the talks were pretty dissapointing, mostly companies pushing their products rather than inspiring us or providing us with new ideas. </p>\n<p>Another cool moment was that for some reason there was an <strong>Oculus Rift</strong> set up with a full cockpit and iRacing. The Oculus definitely does a great job at providing an immersive experience but I found the resolution incredibly low and made it quite hard to use.</p>\n<p>To end with, it was interesting to see that even in <strong>Spain</strong>, the majority of the developers present were coding on a Macbook, taking photos with their iPad and messaging on their iPhone. There was also a small group of diehard Blackberry users doing their best to convince the Android users to make the switch while still being able to develop for Android.</p>',id:"/home/circleci/repo/posts/2013-12-10-DroidCon/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:2,frontmatter:{date:"2013-12-10T12:00:00+00:00",path:"/droicon-mad.html",tags:["tag"],title:"Droidcon"}}}}}});
