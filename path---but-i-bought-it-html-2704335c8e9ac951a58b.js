And it’s all thanks to those few individuals who know the answers that actually share this knowledge with the rest of us.</p>\n<p>And that’s the best thing about todays internet it genuinely feels free, when you ask a question on a forum, they don’t reply, visit these 3 sites and click some ads and then I’ll tell you, no they just tell you and they’re happy to do so.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to find the reason why people, who in normal life would never consider doing their job for free, then login and provide so much.</p>\n<p>So basically what I’m trying to say is, thank you to everyone who shares their knowledge with the rest of us, without these acts the internet would be a very different place.</p>\n<p>\n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 580px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 99.3103448275862%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/png;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="dual monitor"\n        title=""\n        src="/partiallogic-gatsbyJS/static/40a3b25bde8ae63f20b5615637a89de6-7ee4f.png"\n        srcset="/partiallogic-gatsbyJS/static/40a3b25bde8ae63f20b5615637a89de6-785d5.png 148w,\n/partiallogic-gatsbyJS/static/40a3b25bde8ae63f20b5615637a89de6-2f066.png 295w,\n/partiallogic-gatsbyJS/static/40a3b25bde8ae63f20b5615637a89de6-7ee4f.png 580w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </p>\n<p>p.s. thanks to brian from <a href="http://www.shoeboxblog.com/">shoeboxblog</a> for letting me use the image.</p>',id:"/Users/markholland/Documents/js/gatsby/partiallogic-gatsbyJS/posts/2011-05-18-it-knows-all/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:1,frontmatter:{date:"2011-05-18T12:00:00+00:00",path:"/it-knows-all.html",tags:["tag"],title:"It knows all"}},next:!1}}}});
