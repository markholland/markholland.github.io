            '<p>Up until now I’d always discarded <strong>Virtual Reality</strong> as an expensive gimmick. But after how well received <strong>Sony’s</strong> offering has been I came to the conclusion I wanted to try it out. Now as often is the case with recently released and well received technology products. Quickly came the realisation that even though I had decided I would be purchasing the device, actually finding a retailer with stock is easier said than done.</p>\n<p>Fortunately some stock popped up at a reputable retailer and with a £50 discount. Shortly after placing my order I accompanied my purchase with an additional order of the necessary but not included camera and a couple of games.</p>\n<p>The most note worthy part of receiving and setting up the <strong>PSVR</strong> is just how much is involved. By the end you have a mess of cables and extra boxes. You could probably reach a tidy state but you’re still going to have a cable from you to the setup.</p>\n<p>The initial setup is a little tedious and involves you getting the camera pointing just right, this process occasionally returns even in a dark room so there are definitely limitations to the technology being used.</p>\n<p>I began my <strong>VR</strong> experience with the <strong>PSVR</strong> Demos that are included in the box or can be downloaded from the <strong>PS Store</strong>. It’s a collection of demos for nearly all the launch games so provides a wide variety of game play and experiences. The first I loaded was <strong><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/vr-worlds-ps4/">Oceans Descent</a></strong> that is an experience where you are being lowered into the ocean. This is a great demo to start with as I was completely blown away at how quickly it tricked my brain into thinking I was there and found myself reaching out to touch things.</p>\n<p>I tried most of the demos but it was when I tried <strong><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/here-they-lie-ps4/">Here They Lie</a></strong> that things took a turn. There’s a moment where you’re walking through a tunnel and the surroundings start morphing Inception style. I immediately started feeling queasy and my heart was racing. Now full disclosure, I suffer from motion sickness when riding as a passenger in cars so I knew this might happen. I rested for a couple of hours until I felt better and jumped back in as I’d been having so much fun but within minutes the queasiness returned. At this point I decided that although the experience was enjoyable the downside was just too much and that I would be returning it.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend that people give the <strong>PSVR</strong> a chance, the immersion is real and it really shines with the dark atmosphere of the horror genre that is already embracing this medium. But even games I expected to be silly like <strong><a href="http://headmastergame.com">Headmaster</a></strong> that has you heading footballs into goals was surprisingly precise and a lot of fun.</p>',

The album ended up delivering in spades and stayed in constant rotation for a decent amount of time after its release. A rare album where you can play it in repeat and even start with any song while still guaranteeing a great listening experience.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Butch Walker - Afraid of Ghosts.</strong>\nIt has taken a long time for me to get on board with Butch Walker as an artist I truly enjoy but “Afraid of Ghosts” sealed the deal. Single “Bed on Fire” was a song I would consistently return to during the lead up to the album. Hauntingly beautiful from beginning to end.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Forever at Last - Ghosts Again.</strong>\nThis one came out of nowhere and at the same time as a lot of my anticipated releases but I found I kept coming back to this instead. Raw, loud and catchy as hell.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>From First to Last - Dead Trees.</strong>\nI’ve been a long time FFTL fan and I’m in the rare crowd that consider that they’ve gotten better with every release, “Dead Trees” is no exception and sees them breaking new ground in the post hardcore genre. Sad that the band pretty much disappeared as soon as it was released though.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Funeral for a Friend - Chapter and Verse.</strong>\nWhen this first came out I really didn’t like it, they had gone back to an earlier sound for their final release. But after I picked up the album cheap on vinyl I found myself putting it on quite often and it has probably turned into my most played physical record of the year. Melodic chaos.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Light Years - I’ll See You When I See You.</strong>\nThis was the stand out pop punk release for me in 2015. Great melodies front to back.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Plain White T’s - American Nights.</strong>\nPWTs returned in 2015 with the criminally underrated “American Nights”. Easily the best pop album of the year, every single song dripping in gloss.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rubick - Golpe de Efecto.</strong>\nSpeaking of underrated, I’d completely forgotten that this album came out in 2015. Rubick, a Spanish band hailing from Valencia put out their first release in their native tongue after failing to make a big enough splash from their song writing in English (all of which is also underrated).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>This Good Robot - The Light is Taking Me To Pieces.</strong>\nThe band has been around for a long time but it wasn’t until this release that I had the pleasure to check them out. Would fit right at home on the Fueled by Ramen roster circa ’08. Complex, musical while also being chock full of sing along moments.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id="top-eps"><a href="#top-eps" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Top EPs</h3>\n<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/markkholland/playlist/1vJQBD0UxMj78yLRN3cynM">Spotify Playlist</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Against the Current - Gravity.</strong>\nFueled by Ramen are keeping up their tradition of signing bands that are somehow a step above similar sounding artists. Against the Current have delivered an EP packed with songs each of which could easily be lead singles for showcasing their blasting sound to the world. The loudest 3 piece of 2015, released back in February but still sounding fresh.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fourth Line - Everything is Fine.</strong>\n2015 brought a constant stream of great pop punk music but this release was one of the stand outs for me. Just that little bit catchier than the rest.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sundressed - Dig up a Miracle.</strong>\n2015 saw two EPs from Sundressed, I’ve gone with the first of them as it introduced me to the band and probably saw the most play time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>You Me and Everyone We Know - Dogged.</strong>\nAnother highly anticipated release as soon as the first single dropped. Raw sound from guitars to vocals while also bringing great melodies.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>',
