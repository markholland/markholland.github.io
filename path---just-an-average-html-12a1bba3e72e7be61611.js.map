Which is true in a way, not so much recently with all the updates and added features that have come to ios over the years. My problem is that people say “oh unless you jailbreak it, it’s no good”, well when you root your android phone you’re doing the exact same thing! Jailbreaking is gaining root access! And any android user knows you can’t do anything unless you root it.</p>\\n<p>But it doesn’t end there, not only do we all do the same thing to get the most out of our devices but jailbreaking an ios device has always been infinitely easier than rooting an android phone, at one point just by visiting a website you could get your iphone jailbroken!</p>\\n<p>But also the ios scene feels so far ahead of android, just through examples like cydia and installous, central ways to find everything you can add to your jailbroken device, whereas on android you have to crawl google for tutorials or discover websites and visit them repeatedly to find out what’s new.</p>\\n<p>I just think it’s great how not only is ios the easier and slicker os, but so is there entire hacking scene!</p>\\n<p>Sorry but this has been quite a ramble but I’m on the train and felt like putting something out.</p>\\n<p>P.S. This was typed entirely on my phone so pardon the mistakes.</p>\\n<p>Update: I didn’t mention that I hadn’t rooted sooner because htc had promised that the latest version of android 2.3 gingerbread was coming to the desire by July so I thought it best to wait and have a more stable device. Today though, htc announced that they had scrapped plans to bring the update citing the device not having enough memory for the latest version. Just goes to show again the “benefits” of being open…</p>\\n<p>Update 2: Well htc went back on themselves and apparently will release gingerbread for the desire, who knows when, if ever.</p>\",\n\t\t\t\t\"id\": \"/Users/markholland/Documents/js/gatsby/partiallogic-gatsbyJS/posts/2011-06-13-root-of-the-problem/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\n\t\t\t\t\"timeToRead\": 2,\n\t\t\t\t\"frontmatter\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"date\": \"2011-06-13T12:00:00+00:00\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"path\": \"/root-of-the-problem.html\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"tags\": [\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"tag\"\n\t\t\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t\t\t\"title\": \"Root of the problem\"\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t};\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---just-an-average-html-12a1bba3e72e7be61611.js","module.exports = {\n\t\"data\": {\n\t\t\"markdownRemark\": {\n\t\t\t\"html\": \"<p>It won’t be long until I’ll seriously consider disconnecting from the internet and never coming back for fear of imprisonment.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>Nearly all the isps that have instated 3 strikes and you’re out policies are under investigation after all the people who received such warnings had never file shared in their life, don’t leave your wifis open people.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>A Canadian was fined 60.000$ for sharing 2 adult films online….2.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>The British admin of tv shack, a link sharing site not actually hosting any infringing content and probably not even one of the uploaders, is going to be extradited to the U.S. to be charged there….extradited, I remember when that word only came up with terrorists or mastermind thieves not 23 year old students running a site that doesn’t host any infringing material.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Someone was fined 80.000$ when he downloaded an adult movie disguised as out of copyright classical music, something that has happened to all of us I’m sure, begs to ask who posted the disguised file in the first place.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>In the U.S. they’re hoping to pass a law that will make it a felon to embed copyrighted content, see a video you like on youtube and you embed it on your blog which then turns out to be infringing copyright and that will be a felon, do some graffiti, go skateboarding and run a blog and you’re looking at life.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Now the scary thing is these stories are from this week alone.</p>\\n<p>And the worst part is all the lawyers and companies carrying out these acts are all linked in some way to having commited piracy themselves or to be operating outside the law.</p>\\n<p>If you ever receive a letter demanding money because you allegedly infringed copyright, it was probably sent by a firm like Davenport Lyons who were just found guilty of professional misconduct so the tides may be changing on that front but when the notorious acs law firm shuts it’s doors after being threatened with a possible 600.000 pound fine if found guilty just to have it lowered to 800 pounds seeing as the owner now doesn’t have the means for a larger fine, the same owner who goes home to his 700.000 pound house and 2 luxury cars.</p>\\n<p>It looks like a scary future for internet users as long as it continues to be unknown what is ok and what will land us in jail.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative;

Which is true in a way, not so much recently with all the updates and added features that have come to ios over the years. My problem is that people say “oh unless you jailbreak it, it’s no good”, well when you root your android phone you’re doing the exact same thing! Jailbreaking is gaining root access! And any android user knows you can’t do anything unless you root it.</p>\\n<p>But it doesn’t end there, not only do we all do the same thing to get the most out of our devices but jailbreaking an ios device has always been infinitely easier than rooting an android phone, at one point just by visiting a website you could get your iphone jailbroken!</p>\\n<p>But also the ios scene feels so far ahead of android, just through examples like cydia and installous, central ways to find everything you can add to your jailbroken device, whereas on android you have to crawl google for tutorials or discover websites and visit them repeatedly to find out what’s new.</p>\\n<p>I just think it’s great how not only is ios the easier and slicker os, but so is there entire hacking scene!</p>\\n<p>Sorry but this has been quite a ramble but I’m on the train and felt like putting something out.</p>\\n<p>P.S. This was typed entirely on my phone so pardon the mistakes.</p>\\n<p>Update: I didn’t mention that I hadn’t rooted sooner because htc had promised that the latest version of android 2.3 gingerbread was coming to the desire by July so I thought it best to wait and have a more stable device. Today though, htc announced that they had scrapped plans to bring the update citing the device not having enough memory for the latest version. Just goes to show again the “benefits” of being open…</p>\\n<p>Update 2: Well htc went back on themselves and apparently will release gingerbread for the desire, who knows when, if ever.</p>\",\n\t\t\t\"id\": \"/Users/markholland/Documents/js/gatsby/partiallogic-gatsbyJS/posts/2011-06-13-root-of-the-problem/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\n\t\t\t\"timeToRead\": 2,\n\t\t\t\"frontmatter\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"date\": \"2011-06-13T12:00:00+00:00\",\n\t\t\t\t\"path\": \"/root-of-the-problem.html\",\n\t\t\t\t\"tags\": [\n\t\t\t\t\t\"tag\"\n\t\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t\t\"title\": \"Root of the problem\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n};\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/just-an-average-html.json\n// module id = ./node_modules/json-loader/index.js!./.cache/json/just-an-average-html.json\n// module chunks = 130038458320542"],"sourceRoot":""}
