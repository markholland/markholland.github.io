The album ended up delivering in spades and stayed in constant rotation for a decent amount of time after its release. A rare album where you can play it in repeat and even start with any song while still guaranteeing a great listening experience.</li>\n<li><strong>Butch Walker - Afraid of Ghosts.</strong>\nIt has taken a long time for me to get on board with Butch Walker as an artist I truly enjoy but “Afraid of Ghosts” sealed the deal. Single “Bed on Fire” was a song I would consistently return to during the lead up to the album. Hauntingly beautiful from beginning to end.</li>\n<li><strong>Forever at Last - Ghosts Again.</strong>\nThis one came out of nowhere and at the same time as a lot of my anticipated releases but I found I kept coming back to this instead. Raw, loud and catchy as hell.</li>\n<li><strong>From First to Last - Dead Trees.</strong>\nI’ve been a long time FFTL fan and I’m in the rare crowd that consider that they’ve gotten better with every release, “Dead Trees” is no exception and sees them breaking new ground in the post hardcore genre. Sad that the band pretty much disappeared as soon as it was released though.</li>\n<li><strong>Funeral for a Friend - Chapter and Verse.</strong>\nWhen this first came out I really didn’t like it, they had gone back to an earlier sound for their final release. But after I picked up the album cheap on vinyl I found myself putting it on quite often and it has probably turned into my most played physical record of the year. Melodic chaos.</li>\n<li><strong>Light Years - I’ll See You When I See You.</strong>\nThis was the stand out pop punk release for me in 2015. Great melodies front to back.</li>\n<li><strong>Plain White T’s - American Nights.</strong>\nPWTs returned in 2015 with the criminally underrated “American Nights”. Easily the best pop album of the year, every single song dripping in gloss.</li>\n<li><strong>Rubick - Golpe de Efecto.</strong>\nSpeaking of underrated, I’d completely forgotten that this album came out in 2015. Rubick, a Spanish band hailing from Valencia put out their first release in their native tongue after failing to make a big enough splash from their song writing in English (all of which is also underrated).</li>\n<li><strong>This Good Robot - The Light is Taking Me To Pieces.</strong>\nThe band has been around for a long time but it wasn’t until this release that I had the pleasure to check them out. Would fit right at home on the Fueled by Ramen roster circa ’08. Complex, musical while also being chock full of sing along moments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"top-eps\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#top-eps\" aria-label=\"top eps permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Top EPs</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/markkholland/playlist/1vJQBD0UxMj78yLRN3cynM\">Spotify Playlist</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Against the Current - Gravity.</strong>\nFueled by Ramen are keeping up their tradition of signing bands that are somehow a step above similar sounding artists.

The loudest 3 piece of 2015, released back in February but still sounding fresh.</li>\n<li><strong>Fourth Line - Everything is Fine.</strong>\n2015 brought a constant stream of great pop punk music but this release was one of the stand outs for me. Just that little bit catchier than the rest.</li>\n<li><strong>Sundressed - Dig up a Miracle.</strong>\n2015 saw two EPs from Sundressed, I’ve gone with the first of them as it introduced me to the band and probably saw the most play time.</li>\n<li><strong>You Me and Everyone We Know - Dogged.</strong>\nAnother highly anticipated release as soon as the first single dropped.

But after how well received <strong>Sony’s</strong> offering has been I came to the conclusion I wanted to try it out. Now as often is the case with recently released and well received technology products. Quickly came the realisation that even though I had decided I would be purchasing the device, actually finding a retailer with stock is easier said than done.</p>\n<p>Fortunately some stock popped up at a reputable retailer and with a £50 discount. Shortly after placing my order I accompanied my purchase with an additional order of the necessary but not included camera and a couple of games.</p>\n<p>The most note worthy part of receiving and setting up the <strong>PSVR</strong> is just how much is involved. By the end you have a mess of cables and extra boxes. You could probably reach a tidy state but you’re still going to have a cable from you to the setup.</p>\n<p>The initial setup is a little tedious and involves you getting the camera pointing just right, this process occasionally returns even in a dark room so there are definitely limitations to the technology being used.</p>\n<p>I began my <strong>VR</strong> experience with the <strong>PSVR</strong> Demos that are included in the box or can be downloaded from the <strong>PS Store</strong>. It’s a collection of demos for nearly all the launch games so provides a wide variety of game play and experiences. The first I loaded was <strong><a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/vr-worlds-ps4/\">Oceans Descent</a></strong> that is an experience where you are being lowered into the ocean. This is a great demo to start with as I was completely blown away at how quickly it tricked my brain into thinking I was there and found myself reaching out to touch things.</p>\n<p>I tried most of the demos but it was when I tried <strong><a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/here-they-lie-ps4/\">Here They Lie</a></strong> that things took a turn. There’s a moment where you’re walking through a tunnel and the surroundings start morphing Inception style. I immediately started feeling queasy and my heart was racing. Now full disclosure, I suffer from motion sickness when riding as a passenger in cars so I knew this might happen. I rested for a couple of hours until I felt better and jumped back in as I’d been having so much fun but within minutes the queasiness returned. At this point I decided that although the experience was enjoyable the downside was just too much and that I would be returning it.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend that people give the <strong>PSVR</strong> a chance, the immersion is real and it really shines with the dark atmosphere of the horror genre that is already embracing this medium. But even games I expected to be silly like <strong><a href=\"http://headmastergame.com\">Headmaster</a></strong> that has you heading footballs into goals was surprisingly precise and a lot of fun.</p>","id":"7f0e2203-2c98-546b-a5c5-b151aa09b312","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"date":"2016-10-27T03:49:16.408Z","path":"/psvr.html","tags":["videogames"],"title":"My PSVR experience"}}],"tag":[{"excerpt":"Podcasts are taking the world by storm at the moment so I thought I’d chime in with my top 4.

I’ve been listening to podcasts for several years now but it’s true that in the last 12 months the quality of shows has greatly increased and I’ve found myself listening to a lot more shows than ever before.</p>\n<p><strong>1 - Reply all</strong>: I’ll begin with what I believe to be the most engaging podcast, <a href=\"https://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all/\">Reply All</a> from Gimlet Media. Hosted by <strong>PJ Vogt</strong> and <strong>Alex Goldman</strong>. Reply All presents interesting, well investigated stories that are loosely connected to the internet somehow. Ranging from interviewing the inventor of Internet browser pop ups to recordings of the hosts spending a day “outside”. What I love about Reply All is that it’s consistently the first place I’m hearing about the stories told and they are always eye opening tales that just keep you hooked the entire episode. I highly recommend starting from episode 1 because unlike more current news orientated podcasts, the stories in Reply All are timeless.</p>\n<p><strong>2 - Encore</strong>: <a href=\"http://chorus.fm/encore/\">Encore</a> is the recently rebranded podcast for the <a href=\"http://absolutepunk.net\">AbsolutePunk</a> website. This podcast is in my top 4 because the AP website scene best represents my music tastes so I always know that hosts <strong>Jason Tate</strong> and <strong>Thomas Nassiff</strong> will be discussing bands I love or will soon love. It provides lots of behind the scenes tidbits on the music scene, being a music reviewer and running a label. The podcast isn’t 100% music orientated and subjects such as technology, sports and entertainment are all show regulars.</p>\n<p><strong>3 - Modern Vinyl Podcast</strong>: Now I don’t really understand why I enjoy the <a href=\"http://modern-vinyl.com/modern-vinyl-podcast/\">Modern Vinyl podcast</a> so much, it’s probably the chemistry between the hosts resulting in just a fun listen that centres on the latest vinyl releases. The never ending creation of recurring sub-episodes inside shows, each of which have their own theme song keeps the formula fresh.</p>\n<p><strong>4 - Accidental Tech Podcast</strong>: The <a href=\"http://atp.fm\">ATP podcast</a> was probably my gateway into the wider range of technology podcasts leading to me subscribing to most of the offerings from networks like <a href=\"http://5by5.tv\">5by5</a> and <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm\">Relay FM</a>. All three of the hosts also participate in shows on the latter. But what separates this podcast from any of the other tech podcast offerings is the fact that the hosts, <strong>John Siracusa</strong>, <strong>Marco Arment</strong> &#x26; <strong>Casey Liss</strong>, really know their stuff and are all developers by trade. This means that when covering the weekly tech news cycle they will always go into the greatest detail and give points of view that only the heaviest users can provide.</p>\n<p><strong>Honorable mentions:</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Material</strong>: There is a never ending source of podcasts that cover Apple news but shows that centre on their closest rival, Google, are hard to come across. Material from <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/material\">Relay FM</a> fills that void with their weekly round up of all news Google. Great chemistry between hosts <strong>Russell Ivanovic</strong>, <strong>Andy Ihnatko</strong> &#x26; <strong>Yasmine Evjen</strong> leads to a nice addition to my weekly listening.</li>\n<li><strong>The Bugle</strong>: To break with the common theme of technology in my podcast listening habits I also subscribe to <a href=\"http://thebuglepodcast.com\">The Bugle</a> podcast. Hosts <strong>John Oliver</strong> and <strong>Andy Zaltzman</strong> bring a satirical view to the weekly happenings in the world and is a great addition for fans of Johns HBO show <strong>Last Week Tonight</strong>.</li>\n</ul>","id":"d1220c24-6a8e-592c-8317-427e13c835ff","timeToRead":3,"frontmatter":{"date":"2015-10-28T12:00:00+00:00","path":"/top-podcasts.html","tags":["tag"],"title":"Top 4 podcasts"}},{"excerpt":"I’m a big music fan and when most of your life is spent sat in front of a screen well then you have to find a great soundtrack.

For me that means an ever growing and evolving music collection. But as you start to listen to a lot of digital music you begin to wonder whether you should be considering the quality of your listening experience. </p>\n<p>The first step is usually to start worrying about the bit rate of your collection and maybe turning to lossless rips. Usually what will happen next is that you’ll be listening to a song in your upgraded collection and suddenly realise, hey I never heard that instrument before. </p>\n<p>A lot of work goes into making music, but so much of it can be lost through poor reproduction. Once you first encounter this you will start to worry about what else you might be missing.</p>\n<p>My journey began several years ago but it wasn’t until last year when I was finally able to seriously invest in my setup. It started with some headphones from the brand <a href=\"http://www.gradolabs.com/index.php\">Grado</a>, in particular the <a href=\"http://www.gradolabs.com/headphones/prestige-series/item/1-sr80e\">SR80 model</a>.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 580px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Grado SR80\"\n        title=\"Grado SR80\"\n        src=\"/static/7a13333666501432a7324e159d0adbb5/78d0c/gradosr80.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/7a13333666501432a7324e159d0adbb5/a80bd/gradosr80.jpg 148w,\n/static/7a13333666501432a7324e159d0adbb5/1c91a/gradosr80.jpg 295w,\n/static/7a13333666501432a7324e159d0adbb5/78d0c/gradosr80.jpg 580w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>The special thing about these headphones is that they are open backed which provides an incredibly wide soundscape that puts you in the center of the music. An important thing to note though is that being open backed these headphones are not suitable for use in public as there is a substantial amount of sound leakage.</p>\n<p>So now I had high quality digital representations of my music and also some upmarket headphones for getting the analogue waves to my ears. The next logical step is to start worrying about what handles the part inbetween. That is, the part that converts the digital files to analogue signals, this is called the Digital Audio Converter or <strong>DAC</strong>.</p>\n<p>Now DACs don’t come cheap and can carry a price tag in the thousands. For a long time I had my eyes on the <a href=\"http://audioengineusa.com/Store/Digital-Audio-Converters\">D1 model</a> by <strong>Audio Engine</strong>, a simple enough piece of kit that you plug into the USB port of your computer and is then used to power your headphones. But I could never take the plunge because the price was out of my reach and so I continued to worry about my subpar listening experience.</p>\n<p>That was until I came across an Indiegogo project for a USB DAC that I could afford! It was the <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/zuperdac-portable-hifi-music-anytime-anywhere/x/10466974#/story\">ZuperDAC</a> by <strong>Zorloo</strong>. They were promising a high quality DAC packaged entirely in a product the size of a USB pen drive. The fact that the ZuperDAC would be natively supported by <strong>OS X</strong> and <strong>iOS</strong> was enough to sell me on the idea.</p>\n<p>The downside to kickstarter, indiegogo, etc. style purchases is that at the time you’re only buying into the idea, next you have to wait for the actual product to be created before it can be shipped. But after several months of anxiously waiting I now have my hands on a silver ZuperDAC</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 580px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"photo\"\n        title=\"photo\"\n        src=\"/static/8dddbaf496ad330a8eabcc82a9e8f2a2/78d0c/zuperdac.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8dddbaf496ad330a8eabcc82a9e8f2a2/a80bd/zuperdac.jpg 148w,\n/static/8dddbaf496ad330a8eabcc82a9e8f2a2/1c91a/zuperdac.jpg 295w,\n/static/8dddbaf496ad330a8eabcc82a9e8f2a2/78d0c/zuperdac.jpg 580w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Setting up the ZuperDAC couldn’t be simpler, all it takes is plugging one end into a USB port on your computer and then your headphones into the other end.

I’m not that interested in being someone who navigates these perils but I enjoy being knowledgeable enough to talk to those who have made the plunge. </p>\n<p>So when I initially had an idea for a ridiculously simple <strong>iOS</strong> app back in August ‘14, I initially discarded it as it wasn’t going from <a href=\"http://zerotoonebook.com\">zero to one</a> in any way and people certainly weren’t going to pay for it. The entire idea of the app is to display a <strong>YouTube</strong> users subscriber count, that’s it, a single number pulled from the <strong>YouTube</strong> API. Nonetheless I decided to build the app just to see if it was as simple to create as the idea was to come about. I soon moved on and forgot all about it.</p>\n<p>Now the reason there’s any demand for my idea is because the <strong>YouTube</strong> app on <strong>iOS</strong> shows a subscriber count but it isn’t in real time and to budding <strong>YouTubers</strong> keeping tabs on their daily growth this is important. Fast-forward to a month ago and I discovered that the official YouTube app was still showing a stale count and that no one else had thought to spend the hour it took me to build the app and then release it.</p>\n<p>So I made the decision to become a registered <strong>iOS</strong> developer and release my app as it would be a good learning experience having already published apps on <strong>Google Play</strong>. I quickly learned that there were a lot more complications with submitting apps on <strong>iOS</strong> than <strong>Android</strong> and because I was using a 3rd party API I learnt a little bit about trademarks. <strong>YouTube</strong> doesn’t allow their name to be used in an apps name in any way, this includes variations such as YT, my app was originally going to be called ytsubs so that was now out. Even so, because my app relied entirely on the <strong>YouTube</strong> API, I was allowed to use a “Powered by Youtube” logo in my app which give it some sense of polish.</p>\n<p>Now the thing that stuck out for me most with <strong>iOS</strong> is how easy it is to add in the latest capabilities that the OS provides, the app has a widget in the Notification Center, utilises handoff to open your <strong>YouTube</strong> channel on another device and even supports <strong>watch</strong> from day 1.</p>\n<p>So what I thought was a silly idea, and still do, allowed me to learn about all the different areas of <strong>iOS</strong> development with minimal effort. Thanks goes out to my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCScRSwdX0t31gjk3MYXIuYQ\">girlfriend</a> who sparked the idea with her incessant checking of her channel count and now I look forward to seeing how far my app can reach.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 07/09/15</strong>: sub count has seen great response from users and with iOS 9 approaching I recently spent some time preparing <strong>sub count</strong> for <strong>swift 2</strong> and <strong>WatchOS 2</strong>. I’m looking forward to releasing the new and improved version 2.0 of <strong>sub count</strong> as soon as possible.</p>\n<center><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sub-count/id977966794?mt=8&uo=6&at=&ct=\" target=\"itunes_store\">\n\t\t <img alt=\"Download on the App Store\"\n\t\t\t   src=\"badge_appstore-lrg.png\" />\n\t\t </a>\n</center>","id":"c4fe51b7-bff4-5175-9f35-bd0ec9e2aaa2","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"date":"2015-04-13T12:00:00+00:00","path":"/sub-count.html","tags":["tag"],"title":"Sub Count"}},{"excerpt":"Here’s a quick tip I just came across and I’m already kicking myself for not having looked for it before.

You may have noticed that over time when using <strong>terminal.app</strong> that opening a new tab can take a fair amount of time. This can sometimes completely destroy your workflow while you agonizingly wait to be able to start typing.</p>\n<p>What’s going on is that by default, opening a new tab and therefore a new shell session, <strong>terminal.app</strong> uses <em>login</em> as the default command which will show your last login date. In order to get this date it has to search a system log, over time these files become heavily fragmented and lead to this delay.</p>\n<p>But there’s a simple solution to this problem that involves specifying the command that will be executed when launching shell sessions ourselves. <strong>zsh</strong> accepts the parameter ’<em>-i</em>’ and for those stuck on <strong>bash</strong>, you can use ’<em>-p</em>‘.</p>\n<p>Now in order to set this parameter we can open <strong>terminal.app</strong> preferences and choose ”<em>Shells open with: Command</em>”. Now we simply introduce the path to our preferred shell and add the corresponding parameter mentioned before. In <strong>iTerm2</strong> we can also make this change under <em>preferences/profiles/general</em>.</p>\n<p>Hopefully I’m not the last person to have discovered this and I have been of some help.</p>\n<p>Happy Tabbing!</p>","id":"646ca319-d538-5e59-ae56-dffef7540237","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"date":"2015-02-09T12:00:00+00:00","path":"/speedy-terminal-tabs.html","tags":["tag"],"title":"Speedy Terminal Tabs"}},{"excerpt":"During the summer of 2014 I have been making the most of not working by trying out lots of different technologies, Node.js, Verilog, Apple’s new hotness Swift and improving on my still novice status as an Android developer.

After finally grasping most of the Android staples that had always baffled me before, Content Providers, Cursor Loaders, Custom Adapaters, I quickly realised that I could now build the app I had worked on previously in Google Summer of Code 2013, ocw-android but with all these great tools provided by Android.</p>\n<p>So in the space of a little under 3 weeks I completely re wrote the app from scratch and have ended up with something that runs really well and is also fun to use.</p>\n<p>On first opening the app, all data is downloaded as json, parsed and then stored in an sqlite database, any subsequent openings of the app will not require internet and will just load the local data until the user chooses to “Pull To Refresh”.</p>\n<p><img src=\"ocw-release-refresh.png\" alt=\"pull to refresh screenshot\"></p>\n<p>All the views are bound to cursors pulled from the content provider so that should the data in the database change while the service that downloads the json data is running, the views will update automatically.</p>\n<p>On the usability side there are some cool features like a two pane tablet interface.</p>\n<p><img src=\"ocw-2-pane.png\" alt=\"two pane screenshot\"></p>\n<p>And a navigation drawer for filtering the event list by date.</p>\n<p><img src=\"ocw-nav-drawer.png\" alt=\"Navigation drawer\"></p>\n<p>Seeing as my Summer is now rapidly drawing to a close I have decided to wrap up my work on the app for now but you can download the current snapshot of ocw-android-2014 from the Play Store right now!</p>\n<center><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.partiallogic.ocw_android_2014\">\n  <img alt=\"Get it on Google Play\"\n       src=\"en-play-badge.png\" />\n</a></center>\n<p>You can also find all the source code on Github as an Android Studio project.</p>\n<center><a href=\"https://github.com/markholland/ocw-android\">\n  <img alt=\"View on Github\"\n       src=\"GitHub_Logo.png\" />\n</a></center>","id":"51363ab4-6658-536f-9c0b-7f084eb7f209","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"date":"2014-08-29T12:00:00+00:00","path":"/ocw-2014.html","tags":["tag"],"title":"Android revisited"}},{"excerpt":"So with the recent news of Facebook acquiring the Chat service Whatsapp, many felt they had to find an alternative.

I don’t blame them, if a company thinks buying another company is worth x money then they expect to make a lot more than x money from owning it.</p>\n<p>But when people blindly make the switch they might easily be moving to a service with the same intentions or worse than what <strong>Facebook</strong> could turn <strong>Whatsapp</strong> into.</p>\n<p>One of these alternative chat services is <strong>Telegram</strong> that quite surprisingly was already making some impressive traction months before the <strong>Whatsapp</strong> acquisition came about.</p>\n<p>They follow a similar plan as <strong>Whatsapp</strong>, make a great experience and worry about making money once you have an impressive userbase. The difference with <strong>Telegram</strong> is that they are selling themselves as the <strong>“secure”</strong> alternative and because of this claim I’m here today.</p>\n<p>Obviously, why wouldn’t they sell themselves as the secure alternative, it makes great sense with all the <strong>NSA</strong>, <strong>GCHQ</strong> spying being a hot topic these days. Then they throw in that they are open source by making their <a href=\"%22https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram%22\">clients</a> available on github and detailing their <a href=\"%22https://core.telegram.org/mtproto%22\">crypto technique</a>.</p>\n<p>All is well and good making your clients open source and I applaud any company that does but particularly when we’re talking about a chat service whose selling point is security, what use is open source clients when the server remains proprietary. All we can be sure of is that our messages are secure when they’re on the client, as soon as they’re sent to a black box server we have no certainty of what next happens to our messages. More worrying is that <a href=\"%22http://community.kde.org/GSoC/2014/Ideas#Project:_Telegram_Network_Support%22\">multiple</a> <a href=\"%22http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Ideas_for_Google_Summer_of_Code%22\">organizations</a> that have been accepted into this years Google Summer of Code have ideas on their project page to incorporate telegram into their project, this seems crazy to me and incredibly shortsighted.</p>\n<p>Next, detailing your crypto that super Ph.Ds in Maths created is all well and good until people start debunking its security within <a href=\"%22http://unhandledexpression.com/2013/12/17/telegram-stand-back-we-know-maths/%22\">days</a>. Also, making a <a href=\"%22http://thoughtcrime.org/blog/telegram-crypto-challenge/%22\">competition with flawed rules</a>  is a surefire way to turn the community against you even more.</p>\n<p>But let’s step back for a second and imagine that <strong>Telegram</strong> was identical to <strong>Whatsapp</strong>, no claims of security and people use it fully understanding that they have no control over anything once it has been sent, who exactly is <strong>Telegram</strong>? A small startup out to disrupt? Nop, not even close, <strong>Telegram</strong> was founded by the same cofounders of <strong><a href=\"%22http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VK_(social_network)%22\">VK</a></strong>, the second largest social network in Europe. That fact alone should keep people far away from <strong>Telegram</strong>, you don’t trust <strong>Facebook</strong>? A site you use everyday? But you do trust someone in the exact same business of profiting from it’s users information that you don’t even use?</p>\n<p>So what chat service should you use if you want everything to be secure? Well, there probably isn’t and there never will be. There are options like <a href=\"%22https://crypto.cat%22\">Cryptocat</a> but how sure can you really be?</p>\n<p>And this is where I’ve ended up, it all comes down to how much you <strong>Trust</strong> the companies whose products you use, my messenger of choice is currently <strong>Google Hangouts</strong>, it’s probably not secure, <strong>Google</strong> can read everything, the clients suck, but I’ve been using <strong>Google</strong> services for a long time and until now nothing bad has happened so a level of trust has been built up. And that’s it, it’s as safe to use as my trust in the company.</p>\n<p>Nothing more.</p>","id":"9f6a7953-71f4-56cb-a13b-7714da8b30c1","timeToRead":3,"frontmatter":{"date":"2014-03-09T12:00:00+00:00","path":"/telegram.html","tags":["tag"],"title":"FOSS isn't enough STOP Trust is everything STOP"}},{"excerpt":"Best Movies: 2013 was a tricky year for movies, I was starting to wonder if I could even make up a list as I couldn’t think of any blockbusters I’d want to watch again(Apart from White House Down but I’d lose all credibility if I put that on a “Best…","html":"<h3 id=\"best-movies\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#best-movies\" aria-label=\"best movies permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><strong>Best Movies:</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>2013</strong> was a tricky year for movies, I was starting to wonder if I could even make up a list as I couldn’t think of any blockbusters I’d want to watch again(Apart from White House Down but I’d lose all credibility if I put that on a “Best of” list), thankfully good old <strong>indies</strong> came to the rescue.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Place Beyond The Pines</strong> </li>\n<li><strong>The Way Way Back</strong> </li>\n<li><strong>The Kings of Summer</strong> </li>\n<li><strong>Sound City</strong> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>  <strong>Footnote:</strong><br>\nI feel like this list could easily change over the next couple of months as there are a lot of movies I’ve yet to see from 2013 such as “Dallas Buyers Club”, “The Counselor” and “The Wolf of Wall Street” all of which could easily end up topping my list.

It was on <strong>Volley</strong> which is a new framework announced at this years I/O and it provides simpler and faster data transfers. When Volley was announced at I/O I instantly wanted to use it in the app I was working on but it had little to no documentation. I was hoping this might have changed 7 months later but to my dismay, on the powerpoint slide listing the downsides to Volley, the only item was “No documentation”. </p>\n<p>The rest of the talks were pretty dissapointing, mostly companies pushing their products rather than inspiring us or providing us with new ideas. </p>\n<p>Another cool moment was that for some reason there was an <strong>Oculus Rift</strong> set up with a full cockpit and iRacing. The Oculus definitely does a great job at providing an immersive experience but I found the resolution incredibly low and made it quite hard to use.</p>\n<p>To end with, it was interesting to see that even in <strong>Spain</strong>, the majority of the developers present were coding on a Macbook, taking photos with their iPad and messaging on their iPhone. There was also a small group of diehard Blackberry users doing their best to convince the Android users to make the switch while still being able to develop for Android.</p>","id":"017de736-7298-5f19-9868-a229d436a4f7","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"date":"2013-12-10T12:00:00+00:00","path":"/droicon-mad.html","tags":["tag"],"title":"Droidcon"}},{"excerpt":"Earlier this month, Apple unveiled their latest iPhone and one of the most interesting things from the keynote was the fact that they have now moved to a 64 bit CPU.

Today I’m only going to go into one facet of this heated debate.</p>\n<p><strong>“Why don’t digital downloads cost less than their physical counterparts?”</strong></p>\n<p>Now this seems like quite an obvious argument, take for example any music cd, the physical offering requires manufacturing, shipping and then a store to display it in! So surely a digital download must be cheaper, a single copy on a server for the whole world to enjoy.\nWe can apply the same logic to movies, books, magazines and anything else we can digitize and distribute. </p>\n<p>Oh, but servers cost money, and the underlying technology will have license fees and then the power and support needed to keep it running <strong>24/7</strong> all has to be taken into consideration. But I’m not arguing whether this tips the scales in order to make digital downloads the more expensive medium to offer, no, I’m here to propose an idea that isn’t quite so obvious. I’ll demonstrate the general idea with the following images.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 493px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 68.24324324324324%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"bookTrain\"\n        title=\"bookTrain\"\n        src=\"/static/3de455d3bdb520b3be69462ab6941388/f88d0/train-book.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/3de455d3bdb520b3be69462ab6941388/12f09/train-book.png 148w,\n/static/3de455d3bdb520b3be69462ab6941388/e4a3f/train-book.png 295w,\n/static/3de455d3bdb520b3be69462ab6941388/f88d0/train-book.png 493w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Oh look he’s reading a Dan Brown book, which one is that? ah yes “Digital Fortress”, I don’t think I’ve read that one but I really enjoyed his other books.</p>\n<p>Now let’s have a look at what it’ll be like when someone reads the next Dan Brown book.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 460px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 60.13513513513513%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"bookTrain\"\n        title=\"bookTrain\"\n        src=\"/static/8f7011f555423de1afab6c8b1b43810d/08a84/train-kindle.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8f7011f555423de1afab6c8b1b43810d/12f09/train-kindle.png 148w,\n/static/8f7011f555423de1afab6c8b1b43810d/e4a3f/train-kindle.png 295w,\n/static/8f7011f555423de1afab6c8b1b43810d/08a84/train-kindle.png 460w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Oh looks she’s reading…wait, what on earth is she reading? Now you may not care, but the company that published whatever she’s reading definitely does care about the fact that you don’t know, they relied on every sale of that book to then lead on to a possible number of others seeing them reading that book, be interested, and maybe end up buying it themselves.</p>\n<p>This is the <strong>crux</strong> of my view, digital downloads have wiped out enormous advertising streams. When you go round to your friend’s house and see their cd rack and realise, “hey  there’s that Adele lady, maybe I should check her out”. When someone walks out of blockbuster holding the latest Batman movie or sitting on a bench skimming the latest issue of GQ, all this is providing an incredible amount of advertising and when you go digital, this all dissapears.</p>\n<p>This is also incredibly <strong>powerful</strong> advertising, the kind social media sites are desperately trying to duplicate, trustworthy recommendations, not, buy this because we say so banner ads.</p>\n<p>So my theory is that digital download prices are set where they are because the distributors are forced to try and offset the lost knock on sales that the physical offering provided.</p>","id":"f9c8d105-7183-5443-9aa2-b1506bee3c9b","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"date":"2013-04-18T12:00:00+00:00","path":"/digital-downloads.html","tags":["tag"],"title":"Digital Downloads"}},{"excerpt":"I was lucky enough to receive some old tech to tinker with, to be exact, a 2001 Power Mac G4.

Let you guys know how much I’m enjoying having a Macbook and the way it has improved my productivity and outlook on what a computer experience should be like.</p>\n<p>But today I won’t be talking about the why but the how I reached this point, because in a way, I may have cheated slightly by doing everything I can think of to get the most performance out of the Macbook that I have. If I hadn’t done everything I discuss, then my opinion of OSX may be a little different.</p>\n<p>So let’s start with what I’m working with, I have an “Early 2009” white Macbook, this is the pre-unibody model with a Core 2 Duo processor.  The state I received it in was with the stock 2GB of RAM and the 80GB mechanical hard disk along with a faulty disk drive and no working speakers.</p>\n<p>But obviously I wasn’t going to let this Macbook live on without trying to up some of these specs. The first thing I did was stick in a spare sata II SSD, that made a difference and the whole system became instantly more usable and piqued my interest to see what else could be done.</p>\n<p>My next acquisition was a RAM upgrade to 4GB, unluckily, this laptop is still using DDR2 technology which is quite a bit more expensive than the current mass produced DDR3 technology. But as soon as I’d put the new modules in the change was definitely notable and pushed the laptop from being “usable” to actually becoming a valid machine to get some work done on.</p>\n<p>I kept it like this for several months without any more changes, during this time I was able to become more familiar with OSX and all it’s subtleties that just make you think “of course it does that, why wouldn’t it?” and then “why doesn’t everything do this?“. This kept going until I was no longer using my other laptop, a 2012 Thinkpad with all the bells and whistles, a great laptop, but I just wasn’t as productive on it. Then more recently I was finding that when I was sat at my desk using my desktop PC I’d find I’d rather be doing the same work but on my Macbook. This lead me to my most recent string of changes.</p>\n<p>After realising that I could just connect the Macbook to my desktop monitor and see if I actually would be more productive, I ran out that same day to the local Apple store and picked up the mini-dvi to dvi adapter. Now I must mention that my local Apple store has barely been open a year, yet it had in stock an adapter that was superseded by mini display port adapters way back in ‘09. So I got home and hooked it up and quickly realised that this was the perfect setup for getting work done and has made me fully believe that the desktop isn’t the way to go, a single machine in your laptop and then a hub at home for providing a larger workspace.</p>\n<p>Now being an old Laptop, it has old technology and old technology tends to have trouble running the latest OS and software. Well my Macbook is no exception and it can tend to get a little hot when doing too much at once. I’d read a lot about Macbooks sometimes overheating but they always quoted numbers in the 90 plus degrees when idle, this definitely didn’t apply to my situation but I was still curious if anything could be done. I eventually cracked and decided to replace the thermal paste on the processor and graphics, this would be my first time replacing thermal paste on a laptop so I was little unsure if was taking one too many risks. I couldn’t have been more wrong, I’d already dismantled the Macbook many times before, it gets pretty dusty in there as you can see below but removing the heat sink was just one more quick step and I was good to go.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 580px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAPCAIAAABr+ngCAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAADZ0lEQVQozw3L207bBgCAYUuDJI4dH+JT7PgY2zh2TibBSWxwnJBAIIEUqjQtZARoSWhZDww6VA1WTVpZ167TpFaTWmnatKtJk1Ztu9oeYZd7ht3tKYb0X34/EEKmwshUlApFsGmICkWJEGPCTCYWjn0gVXGlRiMCDHMwlSYJHYtSkQgZAcnwlQfj00AEm4oxYVwGIToEsxHKhLQGhvNhsQA5I97scqgUM9pq5/Nm+7ym+AKmwGQaIU0ES0EAqUVpC0b4MJsD+SIkOLBUgVl52t2hKrussUQr87i5Kjbue0snbnbdoM2o5Au8J7FzHIALEUQA8RSoN6DyEC0N0FxlutyBm8fJbI+QXCzdTugNhsmxdJYhZgg6g8k+nWrKSYcBICZ8NVMWnO+hrRPCuxFbaIY6p2zzWFb8hOyRkpuQfVH0eMEVKS1GCGHKQOQFiitiAJVG4AQozEHLj4lgEreroc4YG3wlGm1B8ZPWGq81NdZmcRXlHUZ0WcFGk0WGK3GURQJ4CkUlqDoiVp5Q5fVosxcavhD23ujFAW+u6dZ6Tm6YoichHMgVSGeoZTZ1fUWT6yneFQFUhOMqsnRC18dE41po74v43R+0rZeaPxGq+6bVK4lBRglmsj1Jb0lGW1HrKl9m9bYk15IAJsOcjS9/wtRuoP2DyN43/PbX6sV7r32Sdnay3u1q8WahtJXL97P5DZm24kKF50qMNC+SFg2gQjRZRIOPyNom2H9C3Hop9J/JF7/NHb5znA/V8ijtjRfc8fLsLcdop2aWdCXQBFeiCwKm0gBp4GQGy/SowjWyMmLqRwl/IvkTa/91MH5bDY6MxUd2/X5+8aGVWdeT1TTvGuycqi7KvEMClEkwGZwt0rjJpVd5LaDVOmOuK9mu0j2daT7QrG7Svi7YfTm9yiVdgXVkzGAJk0rkESBCReMqqNYYNUiV+ra/U+l+vFDZnXF3lFRdmt1Mu6NCcXt2/nZl6aG3dlbvPq73zoLr5/7W5TzQvGeVB2LjoLP36s7pj5PTn46/+/v5l38dHr7rVPa95Qe1my+6T/989vt/P1/8ce/sl927bwe7r7prp27raBbYuCi1juyVRyvbl4M73141fPr+8Nd/L7//59OFg8DZKrdOgs55Z+OzbmloZzd1tcknyxhjxwgz+j9PhrgR3pd2bQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"dusty monitor\"\n        title=\"dusty monitor\"\n        src=\"/static/26c725b6803bfc177d8fa2d8ce01ec40/b6272/dusty-macbook.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/26c725b6803bfc177d8fa2d8ce01ec40/12f09/dusty-macbook.png 148w,\n/static/26c725b6803bfc177d8fa2d8ce01ec40/e4a3f/dusty-macbook.png 295w,\n/static/26c725b6803bfc177d8fa2d8ce01ec40/b6272/dusty-macbook.png 580w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>So what are the results, well, idle temperatures have dropped 10 degrees to below 50ºC. Now for a 65nm die inside a laptop this is pretty decent, obviously under load those temperatures can still rise pretty quickly but I’ve found that I can now do some light web browsing on the sofa without melting my thighs, a huge plus and made the risk truly worth it.</p>\n<p>You may remember that I mentioned that when I received the laptop the speakers weren’t working, well this was due to a problem where the optical audio connector(Macbooks have optical???) at the back of the headphone socket is permanently on from grime getting in there and causing the switch to stick. On several occasions I had attempted to resolve this problem by poking around a bit with the stick of a cotton bud but to no avail. While still on a high of having successfully replaced the thermal paste I decided to give it another shot. So I took a safety pin and bent the end into a little hook, now the good thing about the audio socket problem is that seeing as the optical signal is always on this means that the red light is always on and sufficiently illuminates the inside of the socket so that you can identify the different contacts and switches. I was able to hook under the switch for the optical audio which can be found right at the back of the socket and gave it a good tugging and to my relief the red light switched off and stayed off, I hit the volume keys and lo’ and behold I had sound.</p>\n<p>And that brings me up to today. Where I’m sat at my desk writing this on the external monitor that’s connected to the Macbook while watching the legend Dave Grohl give his SXSW keynote on the screen below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"dual-monitor.jpg\" alt=\"dual monitor\"></p>\n<p>I have some remaining ideas to further improve on my work so far, but they require monetary investment and that is always a tough decision, just how deep a hole to dig. What I’d love to do is come across a trackpad from a Macbook pro from the same year. Although at first sight they may seem identical, the pro has multi-touch gestures and I  just know that 4 finger spaces switching would bring a whole new level to my workflow. And while we’re at it, a new battery would be great, not that there’s much wrong with this one relatively speaking, its solid 3 hours of duration puts it in line with most budget laptops, but with 700+ cycles and 81% of the original capacity indicates that I could have a lot more. Sometime I wonder about fixing the optical drive as I’m sure that it’s possible but I just know that I would never use it. One of the first things I did to the laptop was remove the optical disk drive completely, I can’t stand the noise it makes every time you switch on the Macbook.</p>\n<p>I never could have done anything without the great info provided by the following sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ifixit.com/Device/Mac\">ifixit guide</a> to taking apart the Macbook.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150168825311304&#x26;set=a.10150168825306304.300375.599361303&#x26;type=1&#x26;theater\">This crude drawing</a> of the inside of a headphone jack by Katherine Bruens.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And countless other threads on <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/\">macrumors</a> and <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/\">stackoverflow</a> that provided those morsals of information that made all this possible.</p>","id":"39c01d60-f0b6-57ac-9a35-19a1dfbd88e7","timeToRead":5,"frontmatter":{"date":"2013-03-14T12:00:00+00:00","path":"/rotten-apple.html","tags":["tag"],"title":"Turning back time on a rotten Apple"}},{"excerpt":"I’m not an expert on the Raspberry Pi, I barely find time to use mine except for watching videos on our old cathode TV at home.

But I do get a lot of people asking me whether they should buy one, this has recently become less about whether they want a cheap Linux computer as to why the Raspberry Pi should be the cheap Linux computer they buy.</p>\n<p>After the huge success that the Raspberry Pi has enjoyed it was obvious that it wouldn’t be long until the cheaper “more” powerful clones would arrive. So now I found myself having the same old age argument of that specs shouldn’t be the bottom line when considering a purchase and never has this been more so than with the Raspberry Pi vs its competition.</p>\n<p>I’m not going to give any examples of the competition as I don’t want to in anyway advertise an inferior product, there isn’t even any need to draw comparisons as the differences are at the fundamental level.</p>\n<p>It’s really an apples and pears comparison, they’re designed and marketed to different crowds but as always people will think they can get a better deal without considering the trade-offs.</p>\n<p>The  following is a simple list of what I consider as advantages against the current competition:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The hardware of the Raspberry Pi is 100% open source. This is incredibly important, maybe not to an end user but it allows developers to get every last drop of performance out of the provided hardware. It also makes developers life a lot easier at porting software and operating systems to the hardware. We are already seeing the fruits of this with stable ports of XBMC, plan9 , ARCH, RISC OS and countless others.</li>\n<li>It has complete GPIO pin out, again to the end user this may not be of a lot of interest (although I recommend it as a lot of fun can be had with such low-level hardware access), but what it allows is third parties to create add-ons for the Raspberry Pi. There already exists a prototyping board add-on <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/products/801\">prototyping board add-on</a> and soon there will be an <a href=\"http://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/cameraboard.jpg\">official HD camera add-on.</a></li>\n<li>Power consumption: As a headless server running LAMP the power consumption of the Raspberry Pi can drop to a mere 0.3A, any USB phone charger is perfectly capable of running it, whereas most of the competition seems to consume on average 2A or more.</li>\n<li>Connectivity: The Raspberry Pi has 2 USB ports, a 100Mb Ethernet port, HDMI port, audio-out jack and an RCA port. Most of the competition is missing the Ethernet port(<a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/raspberry-pi-meets-lego-in-supercomputer-like-cluster-photos-7000004209/\">You can use this to connect multiple Raspberry Pi together in order to scale performance</a> ), have one USB port(you would need a  hub just to be able to connect a keyboard and mouse), A micro HDMI port(less common and require a special adapter) and no separate audio out(you have to rely on HDMI for all audio connectivity).</li>\n<li>And I’ve saved the best until last, Community, the most important thing any open source project can have, and the Raspberry Pi has one of the biggest and varied communities that is currently thriving. Every week a port of some ancient operating system or some new ingenious contraption with a Raspberry Pi at it’s core is unveiled. There are countless websites and forums where you can find out new things to try out and to find help in solving your problems. This is the beauty of everyone running the same hardware, there’s a larger percentage of the population dedicated to this specific device.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This list has been written considering that you are someone who knows they must have a Raspberry Pi but think a cheaper alternative will provide the same experience. Reaching the previous decision of knowing you can make use of a Raspberry Pi is an entirely different argument that I won’t go into.</p>\n<p>If there’s any other advantages I’ve missed out or if you think I’ve unfairly represented the competition then please let me know in the comments.</p>","id":"bf7d5ba1-bb86-51d5-83b9-8e27e3b2f9fe","timeToRead":3,"frontmatter":{"date":"2013-01-13T12:00:00+00:00","path":"/fake-raspberry.html","tags":["tag"],"title":"Not all Raspberry's are created equal"}},{"excerpt":"This year has been a long one so I thought it deserved a brief rundown of what caught my attention the most, I’ll probably neglect some great things from early on in the year but that’s the nature of a list compiled so long afterwards.

The first time was also extra special as it was the midnight screening after seeing the previous 2 films in the same theatre. Seen it a couple of more times since and it’s still a thrill to watch.</li>\n<li><strong>21 Jump Street.</strong> I even surprised myself by putting this second but remembering how much I loved this movie and still loved it after watching it countless times there was no doubt about it’s place on this list. Some of the best jokes and one liners and it even made me think Channing Tatum might not be so bad.</li>\n<li><strong>Iron sky.</strong> Ever since I first saw the trailer and thought “what on earth is this, I can’t even…” it already had a spot reserved on this list. At times it can be hard to stay engrossed when a movie is so heavily wrapped in CGI but they pulled it off.</li>\n<li><strong>Nitro Circus: The movie.</strong> Yes, I’m going to include action sports in my movie rundown because they are what I watch the most. This movie is ridiculous, stunts that merit being in an action movie yet performed by a group of friends just looking to have some fun and push themselves.</li>\n<li><strong>Girl &#x26; Chocolate: Pretty Sweet.</strong> This year has been pretty slow for Skateboard movies but the much anticipated sequel to 2003’s “Yeah Right” was spectacular. It was a bit of a shock getting used to the young blood having the longer parts and old legends such as Koston, Howard, Caroll and Biebel relegated to cameos but after re watching Pretty Sweet several times there’s no way I couldn’t include it on this list.</li>\n<li><strong>Honorable mention:</strong> The Perks of Being a Wallflower. if you were to ask me now, I would have put this in first place but it’s still a recent movie for me so I felt it should be left off.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Best Music:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>I See Stars - Digital Renegade.</strong> I haven’t listened to it for a couple of months but it’s at the top of my last.fm so there’s no denying the top spot here as well.</li>\n<li><strong>The Wedding - No Direction.</strong> I can’t explain why I love this album so much but the fact that it only took me one listen to head straight to Amazon and order it should say more than words.</li>\n<li><strong>Set it Off - Cinematics.</strong> Scene + Melodies + Orchestra, enough said, will probably be playing it long into 2013.</li>\n<li><strong>Handguns - Angst.</strong> Seeing as Man Overboard didn’t release an album this year I was left with the next best thing.</li>\n<li><strong>Enter Shikari - Flash Flood of Colour.</strong> I had to double check that this actually came out this year as it feels so long ago and with a release date of the 16th January it just scrapes into this years list.</li>\n<li><strong>Honorable mention:</strong> Muse - The 2nd Law. A huge album that I’ve listened to a lot but it’s been a long time since I last did and I feel that stops it from making a “best of” list.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Video Games:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Alan Wake (PC).</strong> Although this game technically first game out a few years ago on xbox and I played it their first, I can’t miss an excuse to have it on another list seeing as it was only released on PC this February. Favourite game ever, it’s hard to even put it in the same chart as traditional video games as this transcends everything before it. The most scared I have ever been in my life has been playing this game.</li>\n<li><strong>Sniper Elite V2 (PC).</strong> A bit of a niche title but has some of the best graphics I’ve seen matched with flawless gameplay earned it a solid second place on my list.</li>\n<li><strong>Max Payne 3 (PC).</strong> It may not have been what everyone had hoped from Rockstar but this was still a solid effort along with a Story that kept on going all the while keeping it fresh made this one of the few games I played through twice.</li>\n<li><strong>Honorable mention:</strong> Battlefield 3 (PC). Although the core game was released in 2011 the added multiplayer modes and maps that have been introduced over this year and with still one more pack to drop I felt this game has done a great job at keeping me playing through 2012.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Best Gadget:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are they even gadgets anymore? My gadget of 2012 is my laptop, a 15” Thinkpad, I felt it needed mentioning as without it I wouldn’t have had such a successful summer with GSOC and as the work I did is how I define my year it earned some of the limelight.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Fail of the year:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Windows 8. Yes, I use it, but if they had just brought the performance boosts and the sharper theme they would have had a winning solution, the whole metro thing is just awful. Along with all the little niggles I keep coming across have earned the latest from Microsoft my thumbs down this year.</li>\n</ul>","id":"c2231f2e-cc7f-5234-a534-b11f6a7060ac","timeToRead":4,"frontmatter":{"date":"2012-12-27T12:00:00+00:00","path":"/best-of-2012.html","tags":["tag"],"title":"Best of 2012"}},{"excerpt":"To round off 2012 I’m going to finally get around to mentioning an amazing project I stumbled across several years ago.

A pop up will appear asking about “Enter pages to be excluded from merging” just hit cancel to load the whole PDF.\nOnce it has opened the PDF you’ll be presented with what makes this program so powerful yet easy to use.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 580px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 74.32432432432432%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"image\"\n        title=\"image\"\n        src=\"/static/6b4fbfa988bf6a74c86d17d80278edc0/b6272/briss-before.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/6b4fbfa988bf6a74c86d17d80278edc0/12f09/briss-before.png 148w,\n/static/6b4fbfa988bf6a74c86d17d80278edc0/e4a3f/briss-before.png 295w,\n/static/6b4fbfa988bf6a74c86d17d80278edc0/b6272/briss-before.png 580w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>What you should see is one or multiple pages of the PDF with some blue boxes over the text, don’t worry if the text looks scrambled behind the blue boxes.</p>\n<p>Now how this works is you drag and resize the blue boxes over the content that you want to make up a page, you can create more blue boxes by just clicking then dragging where there isn’t already a blue box.

So I contacted the SourceForge projects that were involved, to see how their summer went.</p>\n<p>Some of them are still hard at it, and expect to go all the way up to the hard end date, but a few were ready to talk about how great their summer was.</p>\n<p>I heard from Sancho Lerena of the Pandora FMS project, who told me that the summer went very well.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Give us an overview of what your project is.</p>\n<p>Pandora FMS is an all-purpose monitoring system, but very oriented to big sites ( > 1000 nodes). It’s very very flexible and able to get information from almost any kind of source, and produce useful reports, alerts, graphs, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What was your student’s assignment?</p>\n<p>We try to use the student time in small and isolated tasks, or subprojects. We have three students and put each of them in different tasks, so they get interaction only with other developers in the project. They have been evolving a event viewer for Android and the Android agent, adding some features and increasing the usability and stability. Our other student has developed (from scratch) a Chrome and Firefox extension to show monitoring events by using our Web API.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Was the assignment completed to your satisfaction?</p>\n<p>VERY satisfied.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When can we expect to see the fruits of the summer’s work in a released version?</p>\n<p>Of course, all of three subjects has been produced useful code and will be used for next version, probably even before, because all of them are using interfaces and/or API compatible with current version, so, in a few weeks probably we’ll release something. All of this time they have been working with our SVN server, on Sourceforge, of course </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Would you participate in GSoC again?</p>\n<p>Will be a pleasure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What advice can you give to a project interested in GSoC for next year?</p>\n<p>Try to locate small parts of the project, something which don’t require learning a full API, a full architecture or Database design. Do a “roadmap” based on isolated subtasks, so if you there are any delays, you can remove some points, but have something functional at the end. If you plan five subtasks, but at the end you get only three, but these three are OK – you’ve got something to evolve and do more things in the future.</p>\n<p>We had good luck, and two of the students (one from Spain, and other from UK) were near our main office, so we organized a small meeting at the beginning, That was useful to meet people and talk about what we all expected – much better than an IRC Meeting. With the other student, from Singapore, gtalk was the best tool to keep updated on progress and give tips.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/blog/pandora-fms-and-gsoc/\">Source</a></p>","id":"a9a9b46f-ca73-5bd9-a31e-bbecd8de93ec","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"date":"2012-08-21T12:00:00+00:00","path":"/pandora-fms-gsoc.html","tags":["tag"],"title":"PandoraFMS and GSoC"}},{"excerpt":"This years Google Summer of Code is drawing to a close, I’ve finalised all the functionality of my project and now it’s crossing fingers that I don’t hear back about any bugs.

Which is true in a way, not so much recently with all the updates and added features that have come to ios over the years. My problem is that people say “oh unless you jailbreak it, it’s no good”, well when you root your android phone you’re doing the exact same thing! Jailbreaking is gaining root access! And any android user knows you can’t do anything unless you root it.</p>\n<p>But it doesn’t end there, not only do we all do the same thing to get the most out of our devices but jailbreaking an ios device has always been infinitely easier than rooting an android phone, at one point just by visiting a website you could get your iphone jailbroken!</p>\n<p>But also the ios scene feels so far ahead of android, just through examples like cydia and installous, central ways to find everything you can add to your jailbroken device, whereas on android you have to crawl google for tutorials or discover websites and visit them repeatedly to find out what’s new.</p>\n<p>I just think it’s great how not only is ios the easier and slicker os, but so is there entire hacking scene!</p>\n<p>Sorry but this has been quite a ramble but I’m on the train and felt like putting something out.</p>\n<p>P.S. This was typed entirely on my phone so pardon the mistakes.</p>\n<p>Update: I didn’t mention that I hadn’t rooted sooner because htc had promised that the latest version of android 2.3 gingerbread was coming to the desire by July so I thought it best to wait and have a more stable device. Today though, htc announced that they had scrapped plans to bring the update citing the device not having enough memory for the latest version. Just goes to show again the “benefits” of being open…</p>\n<p>Update 2: Well htc went back on themselves and apparently will release gingerbread for the desire, who knows when, if ever.</p>","id":"1fe8502f-41b3-5aa3-9557-e1cc0af5d008","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"date":"2011-06-13T12:00:00+00:00","path":"/root-of-the-problem.html","tags":["tag"],"title":"Root of the problem"}},{"excerpt":"I’m not anti-apple, not even in the slightest.

The unibody construction gives you the feeling of one solid piece of kit that you interact with, no annoying creaks to be heard here. The smaller screen, yet higher resolution than most 15.4″ pc laptops shows there’s no skimping on the spec.</p>\n<p>All in all I can understand why people choose to spend their money on macs, it’s not a decision I personally would make, I’d never buy the most expensive car, the most expensive tv, the most expensive fridge so why should I buy the most expensive computer? But I now see macs as the best computers partly justifying why they’re the most expensive.</p>\n<p>And so here I leave you, I have to return this tomorrow and go back to my Windows 7 netbook which works perfectly fine but just lacks that <em>grimace</em> “Magic”.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

But after how well received <strong>Sony’s</strong> offering has been I came to the conclusion I wanted to try it out. Now as often is the case with recently released and well received technology products. Quickly came the realisation that even though I had decided I would be purchasing the device, actually finding a retailer with stock is easier said than done.</p>\n<p>Fortunately some stock popped up at a reputable retailer and with a £50 discount. Shortly after placing my order I accompanied my purchase with an additional order of the necessary but not included camera and a couple of games.</p>\n<p>The most note worthy part of receiving and setting up the <strong>PSVR</strong> is just how much is involved. By the end you have a mess of cables and extra boxes. You could probably reach a tidy state but you’re still going to have a cable from you to the setup.</p>\n<p>The initial setup is a little tedious and involves you getting the camera pointing just right, this process occasionally returns even in a dark room so there are definitely limitations to the technology being used.</p>\n<p>I began my <strong>VR</strong> experience with the <strong>PSVR</strong> Demos that are included in the box or can be downloaded from the <strong>PS Store</strong>. It’s a collection of demos for nearly all the launch games so provides a wide variety of game play and experiences. The first I loaded was <strong><a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/vr-worlds-ps4/\">Oceans Descent</a></strong> that is an experience where you are being lowered into the ocean. This is a great demo to start with as I was completely blown away at how quickly it tricked my brain into thinking I was there and found myself reaching out to touch things.</p>\n<p>I tried most of the demos but it was when I tried <strong><a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/here-they-lie-ps4/\">Here They Lie</a></strong> that things took a turn. There’s a moment where you’re walking through a tunnel and the surroundings start morphing Inception style. I immediately started feeling queasy and my heart was racing. Now full disclosure, I suffer from motion sickness when riding as a passenger in cars so I knew this might happen. I rested for a couple of hours until I felt better and jumped back in as I’d been having so much fun but within minutes the queasiness returned. At this point I decided that although the experience was enjoyable the downside was just too much and that I would be returning it.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend that people give the <strong>PSVR</strong> a chance, the immersion is real and it really shines with the dark atmosphere of the horror genre that is already embracing this medium. But even games I expected to be silly like <strong><a href=\"http://headmastergame.com\">Headmaster</a></strong> that has you heading footballs into goals was surprisingly precise and a lot of fun.</p>","id":"7f0e2203-2c98-546b-a5c5-b151aa09b312","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"date":"2016-10-27T03:49:16.408Z","path":"/psvr.html","tags":["videogames"],"title":"My PSVR experience"}}],"tag":"videogames"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
