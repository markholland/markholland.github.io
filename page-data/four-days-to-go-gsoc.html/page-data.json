It didn’t take long for oems to realise they ought to add this functionality as Microsoft certainly wasn’t going to. But this turned out to be such an awfuly jerky, jumpy experience that most would deactivate the option, until now.</p>\n<p>Forum member MacHater over at <a href=\"http://forum.notebookreview.com/\">notebookreview</a> has released a stand alone program that greatly improves trackpad scrolling on windows pcs. It’s called TwoFingerScroll and allows heavy tweaking of the sensibility and whether to allow horizontal scrolling and even circular scrolling. You can also configure a variety of 2 and 3 finger gestures like 3 finger swipes for alt+tab providing a lion like window switcher.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 361px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 108.78378378378379%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"smooth scrolling\"\n        title=\"smooth scrolling\"\n        src=\"/static/8b939a80d05a027d9a9bd1d854dbc49d/39d76/twofingerscrollnew.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8b939a80d05a027d9a9bd1d854dbc49d/12f09/twofingerscrollnew.png 148w,\n/static/8b939a80d05a027d9a9bd1d854dbc49d/e4a3f/twofingerscrollnew.png 295w,\n/static/8b939a80d05a027d9a9bd1d854dbc49d/39d76/twofingerscrollnew.png 361w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>I highly recommend this for any laptop user and you can grab it from the link below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://forum.notebookreview.com/hp-drivers-software-forum/552462-twofingerscroll-two-finger-scrolling-done-right-more.html\">DOWNLOAD</a></p>","id":"2027236d-8469-58c2-b211-96f9528fc80d","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"date":"2012-05-19T12:00:00+00:00","path":"/silky-smooth-scrolling","tags":["tag"],"title":"Silky Smooth Scrolling"}},"next":{"excerpt":"Today we had a short meeting on IRC in anticipation of GSOC starting in less than a month.

Lot’s to get stuck into and learn how to use, re familiarize myself with Pandora server as I haven’t used it for a couple of weeks, will probably set up my environment on my desktop as well so that I can stay in my room with my nice new fan keeping me cool. Also on the to-do list is acquaint myself with Articas on-line work logging site which will introduce a whole new way of working for me. This will be centred on extensive planning, discussion and documentation before even actually typing any code. Things are going to start getting exciting very fast especially with the GSOC welcome package arriving soon which will bring the funds for me to buy a Galaxy Nexus and thus help make my project ICS compatible!</p>","id":"b23d8303-535f-5827-8eb9-02a0d8bc1f08","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"date":"2012-04-27T12:00:00+00:00","path":"/first-irc-gsoc.html","tags":["tag"],"title":"First IRC meeting"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
