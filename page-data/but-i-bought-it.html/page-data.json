And it’s all thanks to those few individuals who know the answers that actually share this knowledge with the rest of us.</p>\n<p>And that’s the best thing about todays internet it genuinely feels free, when you ask a question on a forum, they don’t reply, visit these 3 sites and click some ads and then I’ll tell you, no they just tell you and they’re happy to do so.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to find the reason why people, who in normal life would never consider doing their job for free, then login and provide so much.</p>\n<p>So basically what I’m trying to say is, thank you to everyone who shares their knowledge with the rest of us, without these acts the internet would be a very different place.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 580px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 99.32432432432432%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"dual monitor\"\n        title=\"dual monitor\"\n        src=\"/static/40a3b25bde8ae63f20b5615637a89de6/b6272/life-before-google.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/40a3b25bde8ae63f20b5615637a89de6/12f09/life-before-google.png 148w,\n/static/40a3b25bde8ae63f20b5615637a89de6/e4a3f/life-before-google.png 295w,\n/static/40a3b25bde8ae63f20b5615637a89de6/b6272/life-before-google.png 580w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>p.s. thanks to brian from <a href=\"http://www.shoeboxblog.com/\">shoeboxblog</a> for letting me use the image.</p>","id":"67a8ba33-1351-52cc-b5a8-cced92d97dc6","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"date":"2011-05-18T12:00:00+00:00","path":"/it-knows-all.html","tags":["tag"],"title":"It knows all"}},"next":false}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
