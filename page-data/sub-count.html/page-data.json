I’m not that interested in being someone who navigates these perils but I enjoy being knowledgeable enough to talk to those who have made the plunge. </p>\n<p>So when I initially had an idea for a ridiculously simple <strong>iOS</strong> app back in August ‘14, I initially discarded it as it wasn’t going from <a href=\"http://zerotoonebook.com\">zero to one</a> in any way and people certainly weren’t going to pay for it. The entire idea of the app is to display a <strong>YouTube</strong> users subscriber count, that’s it, a single number pulled from the <strong>YouTube</strong> API. Nonetheless I decided to build the app just to see if it was as simple to create as the idea was to come about. I soon moved on and forgot all about it.</p>\n<p>Now the reason there’s any demand for my idea is because the <strong>YouTube</strong> app on <strong>iOS</strong> shows a subscriber count but it isn’t in real time and to budding <strong>YouTubers</strong> keeping tabs on their daily growth this is important. Fast-forward to a month ago and I discovered that the official YouTube app was still showing a stale count and that no one else had thought to spend the hour it took me to build the app and then release it.</p>\n<p>So I made the decision to become a registered <strong>iOS</strong> developer and release my app as it would be a good learning experience having already published apps on <strong>Google Play</strong>. I quickly learned that there were a lot more complications with submitting apps on <strong>iOS</strong> than <strong>Android</strong> and because I was using a 3rd party API I learnt a little bit about trademarks. <strong>YouTube</strong> doesn’t allow their name to be used in an apps name in any way, this includes variations such as YT, my app was originally going to be called ytsubs so that was now out. Even so, because my app relied entirely on the <strong>YouTube</strong> API, I was allowed to use a “Powered by Youtube” logo in my app which give it some sense of polish.</p>\n<p>Now the thing that stuck out for me most with <strong>iOS</strong> is how easy it is to add in the latest capabilities that the OS provides, the app has a widget in the Notification Center, utilises handoff to open your <strong>YouTube</strong> channel on another device and even supports <strong>watch</strong> from day 1.</p>\n<p>So what I thought was a silly idea, and still do, allowed me to learn about all the different areas of <strong>iOS</strong> development with minimal effort. Thanks goes out to my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCScRSwdX0t31gjk3MYXIuYQ\">girlfriend</a> who sparked the idea with her incessant checking of her channel count and now I look forward to seeing how far my app can reach.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 07/09/15</strong>: sub count has seen great response from users and with iOS 9 approaching I recently spent some time preparing <strong>sub count</strong> for <strong>swift 2</strong> and <strong>WatchOS 2</strong>. I’m looking forward to releasing the new and improved version 2.0 of <strong>sub count</strong> as soon as possible.</p>\n<center><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sub-count/id977966794?mt=8&uo=6&at=&ct=\" target=\"itunes_store\">\n\t\t <img alt=\"Download on the App Store\"\n\t\t\t   src=\"badge_appstore-lrg.png\" />\n\t\t </a>\n</center>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 13, 2015","path":"/sub-count.html","tags":["tag"],"title":"Sub Count","image":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/0da627146e0506e12a926ee1d3eeaf96/2fb56/subcount-screen.jpg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"prev":{"excerpt":"I’m a big music fan and when most of your life is spent sat in front of a screen well then you have to find a great soundtrack.

For me that means an ever growing and evolving music collection. But as you start to listen to a lot of digital music you begin to wonder whether you should be considering the quality of your listening experience. </p>\n<p>The first step is usually to start worrying about the bit rate of your collection and maybe turning to lossless rips. Usually what will happen next is that you’ll be listening to a song in your upgraded collection and suddenly realise, hey I never heard that instrument before. </p>\n<p>A lot of work goes into making music, but so much of it can be lost through poor reproduction. Once you first encounter this you will start to worry about what else you might be missing.</p>\n<p>My journey began several years ago but it wasn’t until last year when I was finally able to seriously invest in my setup. It started with some headphones from the brand <a href=\"http://www.gradolabs.com/index.php\">Grado</a>, in particular the <a href=\"http://www.gradolabs.com/headphones/prestige-series/item/1-sr80e\">SR80 model</a>.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 580px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Grado SR80\"\n        title=\"Grado SR80\"\n        src=\"/static/7a13333666501432a7324e159d0adbb5/7bf03/gradosr80.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/7a13333666501432a7324e159d0adbb5/7237a/gradosr80.jpg 148w,\n/static/7a13333666501432a7324e159d0adbb5/0cfdf/gradosr80.jpg 295w,\n/static/7a13333666501432a7324e159d0adbb5/7bf03/gradosr80.jpg 580w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>The special thing about these headphones is that they are open backed which provides an incredibly wide soundscape that puts you in the center of the music. An important thing to note though is that being open backed these headphones are not suitable for use in public as there is a substantial amount of sound leakage.</p>\n<p>So now I had high quality digital representations of my music and also some upmarket headphones for getting the analogue waves to my ears. The next logical step is to start worrying about what handles the part inbetween. That is, the part that converts the digital files to analogue signals, this is called the Digital Audio Converter or <strong>DAC</strong>.</p>\n<p>Now DACs don’t come cheap and can carry a price tag in the thousands. For a long time I had my eyes on the <a href=\"http://audioengineusa.com/Store/Digital-Audio-Converters\">D1 model</a> by <strong>Audio Engine</strong>, a simple enough piece of kit that you plug into the USB port of your computer and is then used to power your headphones. But I could never take the plunge because the price was out of my reach and so I continued to worry about my subpar listening experience.</p>\n<p>That was until I came across an Indiegogo project for a USB DAC that I could afford! It was the <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/zuperdac-portable-hifi-music-anytime-anywhere/x/10466974#/story\">ZuperDAC</a> by <strong>Zorloo</strong>. They were promising a high quality DAC packaged entirely in a product the size of a USB pen drive. The fact that the ZuperDAC would be natively supported by <strong>OS X</strong> and <strong>iOS</strong> was enough to sell me on the idea.</p>\n<p>The downside to kickstarter, indiegogo, etc. style purchases is that at the time you’re only buying into the idea, next you have to wait for the actual product to be created before it can be shipped. But after several months of anxiously waiting I now have my hands on a silver ZuperDAC</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 580px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"photo\"\n        title=\"photo\"\n        src=\"/static/8dddbaf496ad330a8eabcc82a9e8f2a2/7bf03/zuperdac.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8dddbaf496ad330a8eabcc82a9e8f2a2/7237a/zuperdac.jpg 148w,\n/static/8dddbaf496ad330a8eabcc82a9e8f2a2/0cfdf/zuperdac.jpg 295w,\n/static/8dddbaf496ad330a8eabcc82a9e8f2a2/7bf03/zuperdac.jpg 580w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Setting up the ZuperDAC couldn’t be simpler, all it takes is plugging one end into a USB port on your computer and then your headphones into the other end.

You may have noticed that over time when using <strong>terminal.app</strong> that opening a new tab can take a fair amount of time. This can sometimes completely destroy your workflow while you agonizingly wait to be able to start typing.</p>\n<p>What’s going on is that by default, opening a new tab and therefore a new shell session, <strong>terminal.app</strong> uses <em>login</em> as the default command which will show your last login date. In order to get this date it has to search a system log, over time these files become heavily fragmented and lead to this delay.</p>\n<p>But there’s a simple solution to this problem that involves specifying the command that will be executed when launching shell sessions ourselves. <strong>zsh</strong> accepts the parameter ’<em>-i</em>’ and for those stuck on <strong>bash</strong>, you can use ’<em>-p</em>‘.</p>\n<p>Now in order to set this parameter we can open <strong>terminal.app</strong> preferences and choose ”<em>Shells open with: Command</em>”. Now we simply introduce the path to our preferred shell and add the corresponding parameter mentioned before. In <strong>iTerm2</strong> we can also make this change under <em>preferences/profiles/general</em>.</p>\n<p>Hopefully I’m not the last person to have discovered this and I have been of some help.</p>\n<p>Happy Tabbing!</p>","id":"646ca319-d538-5e59-ae56-dffef7540237","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"date":"2015-02-09T12:00:00+00:00","path":"/speedy-terminal-tabs.html","tags":["tag"],"title":"Speedy Terminal Tabs"}}}}}
