Which is true in a way, not so much recently with all the updates and added features that have come to ios over the years. My problem is that people say “oh unless you jailbreak it, it’s no good”, well when you root your android phone you’re doing the exact same thing! Jailbreaking is gaining root access! And any android user knows you can’t do anything unless you root it.</p>\\n<p>But it doesn’t end there, not only do we all do the same thing to get the most out of our devices but jailbreaking an ios device has always been infinitely easier than rooting an android phone, at one point just by visiting a website you could get your iphone jailbroken!</p>\\n<p>But also the ios scene feels so far ahead of android, just through examples like cydia and installous, central ways to find everything you can add to your jailbroken device, whereas on android you have to crawl google for tutorials or discover websites and visit them repeatedly to find out what’s new.</p>\\n<p>I just think it’s great how not only is ios the easier and slicker os, but so is there entire hacking scene!</p>\\n<p>Sorry but this has been quite a ramble but I’m on the train and felt like putting something out.</p>\\n<p>P.S. This was typed entirely on my phone so pardon the mistakes.</p>\\n<p>Update: I didn’t mention that I hadn’t rooted sooner because htc had promised that the latest version of android 2.3 gingerbread was coming to the desire by July so I thought it best to wait and have a more stable device. Today though, htc announced that they had scrapped plans to bring the update citing the device not having enough memory for the latest version. Just goes to show again the “benefits” of being open…</p>\\n<p>Update 2: Well htc went back on themselves and apparently will release gingerbread for the desire, who knows when, if ever.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"June 13, 2011\",\"path\":\"/root-of-the-problem.html\",\"tags\":[\"tag\"],\"title\":\"Root of the problem\",\"image\":{\"childImageSharp\":{\"resize\":{\"src\":\"/static/4e9a95cf7025f7dc1da351e45e9f97b3-57c0c.jpg\"}}}}}},\"pathContext\":{\"prev\":{\"excerpt\":\"It won’t be long until I’ll seriously consider disconnecting from the internet and never coming back for fear of imprisonment.

The unibody construction gives you the feeling of one solid piece of kit that you interact with, no annoying creaks to be heard here. The smaller screen, yet higher resolution than most 15.4″ pc laptops shows there’s no skimping on the spec.</p>\\n<p>All in all I can understand why people choose to spend their money on macs, it’s not a decision I personally would make, I’d never buy the most expensive car, the most expensive tv, the most expensive fridge so why should I buy the most expensive computer?

Which is true in a way, not so much recently with all the updates and added features that have come to ios over the years. My problem is that people say “oh unless you jailbreak it, it’s no good”, well when you root your android phone you’re doing the exact same thing! Jailbreaking is gaining root access! And any android user knows you can’t do anything unless you root it.</p>\\n<p>But it doesn’t end there, not only do we all do the same thing to get the most out of our devices but jailbreaking an ios device has always been infinitely easier than rooting an android phone, at one point just by visiting a website you could get your iphone jailbroken!</p>\\n<p>But also the ios scene feels so far ahead of android, just through examples like cydia and installous, central ways to find everything you can add to your jailbroken device, whereas on android you have to crawl google for tutorials or discover websites and visit them repeatedly to find out what’s new.</p>\\n<p>I just think it’s great how not only is ios the easier and slicker os, but so is there entire hacking scene!</p>\\n<p>Sorry but this has been quite a ramble but I’m on the train and felt like putting something out.</p>\\n<p>P.S. This was typed entirely on my phone so pardon the mistakes.</p>\\n<p>Update: I didn’t mention that I hadn’t rooted sooner because htc had promised that the latest version of android 2.3 gingerbread was coming to the desire by July so I thought it best to wait and have a more stable device. Today though, htc announced that they had scrapped plans to bring the update citing the device not having enough memory for the latest version. Just goes to show again the “benefits” of being open…</p>\\n<p>Update 2: Well htc went back on themselves and apparently will release gingerbread for the desire, who knows when, if ever.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"June 13, 2011\",\"path\":\"/root-of-the-problem.html\",\"tags\":[\"tag\"],\"title\":\"Root of the problem\",\"image\":{\"childImageSharp\":{\"resize\":{\"src\":\"/static/4e9a95cf7025f7dc1da351e45e9f97b3-57c0c.jpg\"}}}}}},\"pathContext\":{\"prev\":{\"excerpt\":\"It won’t be long until I’ll seriously consider disconnecting from the internet and never coming back for fear of imprisonment.

It turns out my library at uni has a program for allowing students free loaning of laptops and for whatever absurd reason think it’s necessary for half of those to be macs.</p>\\n<p>So after just 4 days on the waiting list I was granted my macbook for 15 days, the current gen white macbook to be exact.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 300px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 64.33333333333333%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAANCAIAAAAmMtkJAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAACKElEQVQoz2P49/8/EKGBX7//vP/09cev3/+xAYj6f//+MQAxpvTL1+/OX7l9+/6zpy/ffvvx8x9YEVwlXAMWzX///Z+/eJWdvXdddcf2nYev33l8+/6Tdx8+/cVQyYDp7JNnrgQFpjhaentYB3laxRbG1syZvPzIiYs37jx++uLNrz9/4PYzoBn24tX7nqaFYXaZ4c7RcR7x5eHFed45ITaRQY6RsRHpW3ce+vX7L8JmZJ0/fv/euvlEfkB/R8S0yoDy5tjyyRmNjbFlZaE5AZa+cbEZ9x8++Y/keYTmP///3rr9Ynb3gUk5a1anrt6Ss+RQy4rDrUtXlE4oC04NcfQ9feocROc/TJsfPX3d2rRmStnBLYXHt0VuutV14sOee48XnV6dPanRq/jY9uNoUYXQ/PPXn2mL1nKpuZmbFyU5dHVEzj488cjJyXtneremqUbPm7D45+8/4Ij4B9H8DznATl24IesQwmXgIqTlJKfiZKwfaKRqpyikws3AH+Af8eTZC5DOv3/RkgpI84vX75pa+5LSCqobuspr2kuLy6JiU319g+3s3Wxs3Q4cPAZU8/vPH8xIZfjx89edB8+u3Xp05eYDYHq4cefJrXtA9Ozm3ccXrtx+8PgF0MG///z9+es3UCUYgRhfv//48u07KJHcffBk3abtO/ce3LHnwIEjJy5fu3X+0jUgun3v0a27D4GyN+48OHPh6rFT5w+fOHv4OBSdPn8VAFg5cVBNU18rAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"unibody macbook\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/2ff415d46386395c70be7b44239b95c0-adfc8.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/2ff415d46386395c70be7b44239b95c0-b4fb9.png 148w,\\n/static/2ff415d46386395c70be7b44239b95c0-ab48e.png 295w,\\n/static/2ff415d46386395c70be7b44239b95c0-adfc8.png 300w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<p>I’m not going to go into much detail but needless to say I was quickly impressed, It’s all about the subtleties that I won’t bother mentioning seeing as how if you own a mac you already know what I’d say and if you’re a non-user I doubt anything anyone could say would sway you towards osx.</p>\\n<p>What I am going to mention though is that this seems like the best generation of macbook for me to have stumbled across, the new trackpad really does make all the difference, effortlessly gliding around while web browsing brings a whole new level of satisfaction. The unibody construction gives you the feeling of one solid piece of kit that you interact with, no annoying creaks to be heard here. The smaller screen, yet higher resolution than most 15.4″ pc laptops shows there’s no skimping on the spec.</p>\\n<p>All in all I can understand why people choose to spend their money on macs, it’s not a decision I personally would make, I’d never buy the most expensive car, the most expensive tv, the most expensive fridge so why should I buy the most expensive computer? But I now see macs as the best computers partly justifying why they’re the most expensive.</p>\\n<p>And so here I leave you, I have to return this tomorrow and go back to my Windows 7 netbook which works perfectly fine but just lacks that <em>grimace</em> “Magic”.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 580px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 125.51724137931035%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"doghousediaries apple\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/247c48de8b19e91e0e2c82c0ec410ed3-7ee4f.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/247c48de8b19e91e0e2c82c0ec410ed3-785d5.png 148w,\\n/static/247c48de8b19e91e0e2c82c0ec410ed3-2f066.png 295w,\\n/static/247c48de8b19e91e0e2c82c0ec410ed3-7ee4f.png 580w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<p>Big thanks to <a href=\\\"http://www.thedoghousediaries.com/\\\">The Doghouse Diaries</a> for letting me use the comic strip!</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/markholland/Documents/js/gatsby/partiallogic-gatsbyJS/posts/2011-06-06-fruity-computing/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"timeToRead\":2,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2011-06-06T12:00:00+00:00\",\"path\":\"/fruity-computing.html\",\"tags\":[\"tag\"],\"title\":\"Fruity computing\"}}}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/root-of-the-problem-html.json\n// module id = ./node_modules/json-loader/index.js!./.cache/json/root-of-the-problem-html.json\n// module chunks = 71978070213141"],"sourceRoot":""}
