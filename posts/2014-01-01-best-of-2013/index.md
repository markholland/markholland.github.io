###**Best Movies:** 
   
**2013** was a tricky year for movies, I was starting to wonder if I could even make up a list as I couldn't think of any blockbusters I'd want to watch again(Apart from White House Down but I'd lose all credibility if I put that on a "Best of" list), thankfully good old **indies** came to the rescue.

  * **The Place Beyond The Pines** 
  
  * **The Way Way Back** 
  
  * **The Kings of Summer** 
  
  * **Sound City** 


  **Footnote:**  
 I feel like this list could easily change over the next couple of months as there are a lot of movies I've yet to see from 2013 such as "Dallas Buyers Club", "The Counselor" and "The Wolf of Wall Street" all of which could easily end up topping my list. A similar thing happened for **2012** with "Django Unchained".

###**Best Music:** 
 

  * **Chunk! No, Captain Chunk! - Pardon My French**
  
  * **Paramore - Paramore**
  
  * **A Day to Remember - Common Courtesy**

  * **[The Here and Now - Born to Make Believe]("http://blacknumbers.bandcamp.com/album/born-to-make-believe-part-1")**  
  

###**Video Games:**  


  * **Outlast (pc)**  
  As one redditor put it perfectly "Nope simulator 2013". Never has a game put me so on edge, I found I had to play this game in 10 minute intervals as any more would start to seriously affect me with the unbearable tension it creates.
  
  * **Grand theft Auto V (ps3)**  
  If this had been a pc release it would have been at the top of my list but after finishing the main story I couldn't bring myself to 100% it with the lacklustre graphics and loading times that entails a game of such scale being forced onto a console. Still an amazing game that doesn't dissapoint, **Rockstar** definitely delivered with this next installment in the franchise.
  
  * **Bioshock: Infinite (pc)**  
It isn't often that as soon as I finish a game I proceed to start again from the beginnning almost immediately, great mechanics, great story, great graphics. **10/10**.

  * **The Stanley Parable (pc)**  
  It's hard to put this in the main list when it's such a short "game"
 but it has come such a long way since the original **Half Life** mod that it should definitely be mentioned, also, the demo was genius and took meta to a whole new level.
 
###**Best Gadget:**  


  * There have been lots of shiny new devices(**Macbooks, iPhones**..), innovations(**Pebble, Oculus Rift**) but I feel like nothing has really delivered or wowed me yet so there's nothing for me to write about here really.

###**Fail of the year:** 
 

  * Apple from a software standpoint, for the first time I'm encountering buggy programs and unsolvable problems which is very disheartening and I hope they **refocus** and stop worrying about yearly OS releases and dedicate more time refining their great software offerings.
